Problem 2:
==========
Differentiate between mobile and cloud computing.

a.
Mobile computing has limited processing power.

Cloud compusing provides higher processing power due to usage of high
end servers on the cloud.

b.
Mobile computing is constrained by Battery Power

Cloud computing is not constrained by power limitation as there is a
continuous supply of power.

c.
Mobile computing is a physical computing device that can be used
continuously making it convenient to carry around. Laptop, mobile
phone, tablets are some small sized computing devices which allow you
to work on the move. The data is stored in a device you carry.

In cloud computing, your files are stored in a central cloud server
and any system across the globe with an internet connection can access
the files and folders. The data is stored in the server and is shared 
over the web using internet.

d.
Changes, modifications, upgrades made in mobile are limited to your 
local physical storage in mobile computing.

Changes, modifications, upgrades made on cloud are reflected on each
and every device that tries to access it in cloud computing.

e.
In mobile computing, different devices have different architectures.
Hence, applications will have to be built separately to be made
compatible with the targeted devices.

In cloud computing, applications developed on cloud will be independent
of the architecture of the devices that are accessing it. Hence, 
one common development will suffice the performance on across the
different platforms that are accessing the cloud server.
