Problem 3:
==========
Give an example of an application simulating an environment of context aware
computing and justify.

->
Context awareness is a term that describes the ability of the computer to
sense and act upon information about its environment, such as location, time
or user identity. This information can be used not only to tag information
as it is collected in the field, but also to enable selective responses such
as triggering alarms or retrieving information relevant to the task at hand. 

Automatic light as Context-Aware System
---------------------------------------
At house entrances and in hotel hallways automatic lights have become common.
These systems can also be seen as simple context-aware systems. The
contextual parameters taken into account are the current light conditions
and if there is motion in the vicinity. The adaptation mechanism is fairly
simple. If the situation detected is that it is dark and that there is
someone moving, the light will be switched on. The light will then be on as
long as the person moves, and after a period where no motion is detected,
the light will switch off again. Similarly, the light will switch off if it
is not dark anymore.

Context-Aware System in mobile systems
--------------------------------------
A tablet computer switching the orientation of the screen, maps orienting
themselves with the userâ€™s current orientation and adapting the zoom level
to the current speed, and switching on the backlight of the phone when used
in the dark are examples of computers that are aware of their environment
and their context of use.
